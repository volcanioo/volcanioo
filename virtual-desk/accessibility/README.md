# What did I understand?
Web Accessibility means people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the Web. One of the purposes is to make them can **contribute** to the Web. 

There are similar terms to web accessibility, such as UI, UX, Design, Internationalisation. The other term is Web Performance, which aims to fix slow connection issues. So, these terms are very similar but not the same fields. 

For this reason, In general, the medium posts or tutorials that tell people about web accessibility aim to reflect the difference between accessibility and what the developer thinks about accessibility. 

## Facts
There are plenty amount of facts to show why web accessibility is one of the important fields of Web Development.

1. 1 in 6 people is moderately or severely disabled in the world.
2. 15% of the World Population with up to 190 million (3.8%) people aged 15 years and older having significant difficulties in functioning, often requiring healthcare services.
3. **People with disabilities can live and participate in the community. They can become potential users.**

## Why developers should care?
I'm sure that I'll be updating this place a lot. Because, there are plenty amount of perspectives about why developers should care.

> "If we don't make it accessible, then we make it inaccessible." [(*2)](#resources)

There are other reasons why developers should care, such as Human Rights, [Legal Restrictions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/ "Legal Restrictions") and the opportunity of transforming %15 of the local population to potential users. 

# Accessible Web for Everyone
`work-in-progress`

# First Impressions
Oh! Accesibility is a huge topic than what I expected. I love it! In general, it seems very sensitive topic to me. Here are a small paragraph that I really liked from [On Accessibility and the Lack of Proper HTML by Ian Devlin (*1)](https://iandevlin.com/blog/2016/01/opinion/on-accessibility-and-the-lack-of-proper-html/ "(*1)").
 
> That one word can make web developers scream and run for cover or turn a deaf ear and a blind eye (no puns intended) in its general direction. Making sites accessible is also very important, but no matter how many people, regardless of who they are, talk about the importance of making websites more accessible, they are largely ignored. No-one cheers, no-one embraces what is said, and many don’t bother to build their sites with accessibility in mind.

> But why is this? Why do developers ignore those who would benefit from their websites being more accessible? Are they not people too? Do they really want to actively shun these people from accessing their website’s content and use it the way that they need? Is this a conscious decision made by web developers? Is it laziness? Ignorance? Fear? Or do developers simply decide that the number of people who would benefit from such accessibility are, like IE8 users, simply not worth the hassle?
