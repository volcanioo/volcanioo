# Virtual Desk
This repository created to have a virtual desk that contains my detailed research notes that I took while learning something new. I want to use this repository on the weekends to learn new technologies that related to my expertise area or my interests. Each file will have a README file and code examples to show what I understand.

## I aim to..
1. Find my missing points here.
2. Extend my tech knowledge with the reader's contributions, discussions on my virtual-desk.
3. Improve my communication skills and writing skills
