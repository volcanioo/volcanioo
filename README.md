I love to develop useful apps. Currently, I'm working at [Homeday](https://www.homeday.de/de/) a company that makes it quick and straightforward to sell/buy a house in Germany. I'm working on [Website Project](https://homeday.de/) which is entirely structured with Vue Nuxt + Typescript, Jest.

I currently work as a front-end engineer, and at the same time, contribute to the diversity taskforce to have a work environment in which everyone has a high awareness of diversity & inclusion. 

I have a deep interest in software development and technology, which pushes me to keep myself up to date by learning new technologies. I have been working on many projects since 2013 as a front-end developer/engineer and gain every necessary ability to achieve my goals. I love what I do and improve my mentoring abilities for people who want to learn software development nowadays. I also focus on self-awareness and mindfulness topics as well as diversity-related topics. 

I concentrate on my communication abilities continuously and seek feedback at specific points from my environment. I believe in teamwork and try to become a good partner for my counterparts and treat everyone equally regardless of their race, religion, gender, sex, or socioeconomic background. I try to do more empathy and be a good listener rather than an active speaker.
