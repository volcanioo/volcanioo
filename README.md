# Hi 👋🏼
![Image of Yaktocat](me.png)

I like to develop things.

I'm a Front-end Engineer at [Homeday](https://www.homeday.de/de/) a company that makes it quick and straightforward to sell/buy a house in Germany. Currently, I'm working on [My Homeday App](https://my.homeday.de/login) which is entirely structured with Vue. I love Vue but also dabble in React sometimes. 
 
- 👨🏼‍💻 I’m currently working with WebGL for a side project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the main purpose of the bundle approach on javascript.
